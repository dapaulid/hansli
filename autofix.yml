    The error `clang: not found` indicates that the compiler ''clang'' is not present
    or accessible on the system. This results in the build process failing.


    # Corrected file: tests/sources/build-hello.sh

    ```sh

    g++ hello.cpp -o hello```

    The corrected script uses the g++ compiler to compile the hello.cpp file instead
    of clang.'
